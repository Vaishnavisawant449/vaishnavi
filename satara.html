    <h3>The first known Muslim rule of the Deccan took place in 1296. In 1636, 
        the Nizam Shahi dynasty came to an end. In 1663, Shivaji conquered Parali and Satara fort.
         After the death of Chhatrapati Sambhaji (Son of Chhatrpati Shivaji Maharaj), Shahu, heir apparent to 
         the Maratha Kingdom, was captured by Mughals when he was only seven years old.
         He remained their prisoner until the death of Aurangzeb in 1707.</h3>
